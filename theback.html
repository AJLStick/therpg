you walk towards the back of the mega store.

the cashier urges you not to go back there, but
makes no effort to stop you.

when you get there, you notice a message
smeared all over the wall in what appears
to be Mega Storeâ„¢ brand ketchup.

you feel a strong urge to click the message
on the wall.

it's either that, or <a href="around">leave (while you can)</a>
